#Protocol
sbatch to submit a batch to the batch system
activate the conda environment 
#sample collection

#extraction
DNA/RNA/Proteins

#library preparation
PCR(amplicons generated)& sequencing(raw reads i.e short reads generated in form of a fasta file)

#Quality control
tools used:
1.fastqc
checks quality of the reads
2.fastp
trims the reads based on the set phred score limit (usually less han 20) and also checks quality of the reads.

#Genome assembly
##command used in the megahit tool
this will generate contigs (consensus region)
